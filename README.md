# Snip-And-Sketch
Ever wondered if you can take a screenshot like windows Snip and Sketch using python?

#Hello, this is the final(hope so) and interesting version of my project Snip And Sketch

#Things added:
#New Save as option added 
 
#New Paint option added

#Made a mistake while snipping, no problem, you can choose new snip
#Added Fail Safe, in case the user faces any error. They can activate it by pressing ‘Esc’

Thank you!!
