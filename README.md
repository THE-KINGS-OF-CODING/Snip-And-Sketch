# Snip_And_Sketch
Ever wondered if you can take a screenshot like windows Snip and Sketch using python?
This project does the same, it takes the screenshot of particular area and then you can copy it using 'Ctrl + C'.

# Use auto_run.pyw for better results, if it slows you down then you can use snip_and_sketch.pyw diectly.

# auto_run.pyw deletes the screenshot you took and does not use up space, but when you run snip_and_sketch.pyw it saves every screenshot you took.

#Update includes:
1) Adding saveas option
2) painting on the screenshot taken
more will be added soon
# These updates will be added soon
